# Machine_Learning_Models
Developed models of machine learning

## Correlation Coefficient:
- Implemented a Correlation Coefficient calculation to analyze the relationship between two variables (meal amount and tip amount).
- Utilized NumPy for efficient mathematical operations and Matplotlib to visualize the data and regression line.

## Linear Regression:
- Built a Linear Regression model to predict tip amounts based on meal amounts.
- Applied mean normalization and computed slope and intercept to derive the regression line.
- Developed a prediction function to forecast tip amounts and visualized the model's performance using Matplotlib.
